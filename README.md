## 1. Acoustic Levitation: Fundamentals and Equations

### 1.1 Principle of Acoustic Levitation
Acoustic levitation relies on **standing waves** and **radiation pressure** to trap objects at nodes where the net force is zero. The core principles include:
- **Newtonâ€™s Second Law:** The force exerted on an object leads to acceleration.
- **Wave Superposition Principle:** Two opposing waves can interfere to form a standing wave.
- **Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF):** The force acting on a small object in a sound field is derived from the acoustic energy gradient.

#### 1.1.1 Wave Equation
The governing equation for sound waves in air is the **Helmholtz equation**:

$\nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = 0$

where:
- $( p )$ is the acoustic pressure,
- $( c )$ is the speed of sound in air,
- $( \nabla^2 )$ is the Laplacian operator.

For a **standing wave** formed by two counter-propagating waves:

$p(x,t) = P_0 \cos(kx) e^{i\omega t}$

where $( k = 2\pi/\lambda )$ is the wavenumber, and $( \omega )$ is the angular frequency.

### 1.2 Radiation Force on a Levitated Object
The **time-averaged radiation force** is derived from the acoustic potential $( U )$:

$F = -\nabla U$

where $( U )$ is proportional to the acoustic energy density.

For a spherical particle, the force can be approximated as:

$F = -\frac{4\pi}{3} r^3 \rho_m \nabla \left( \frac{p^2}{2\rho_0 c^2} \right)$

where $( r )$ is particle radius, $( \rho_m )$ is its density, and $( \rho_0 )$ is air density.

At **nodes** of the standing wave, the pressure gradient is zero, creating stable levitation points.

## 2. Simulation of Standing Waves
We used **Python simulations** to visualize wave behavior in **1D and 3D**.
- **1D Standing Wave:** Plotted as \( \sin(2\pi x / \lambda) \cos(\omega t) \).
- **3D Standing Wave:** Simulated using:

$W(x,y,z) = \cos(kx) + \cos(ky) + \cos(kz)$

where three standing waves interfere.

## 3. Bayesian Modeling of Levitation Height vs. Frequency
We modeled the relation:

$h = \frac{\lambda}{2} = \frac{c}{2f}$

using **Bayesian inference** to estimate unknown parameters.

We assumed:

$h = a \frac{c}{2f} + b + \epsilon$

where $( a, b )$ are model parameters, and $( \epsilon )$ represents noise.

Using **PyMC3**, we performed **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** sampling to infer $( a, b )$, and the posterior distribution was analyzed.

## 4. Duffing Oscillator: Nonlinear Stability Analysis
The **Duffing equation** models forced oscillators with nonlinearity:

$\ddot{x} + \delta \dot{x} + \alpha x + \beta x^3 = \gamma \cos(\omega t)$

where:
- $( \alpha )$ is the linear stiffness,
- $( \beta )$ is the nonlinear coefficient,
- $( \gamma )$ is the forcing amplitude.

Using **numerical integration**, we analyzed:
- **Phase space plots** (to show attractors),
- **Bifurcation diagrams** (to study chaotic behavior).

## Summary of Key Takeaways
- **Acoustic levitation** is based on standing waves and radiation force.
- **Simulations** help visualize stable regions where objects levitate.
- **Bayesian inference** allows us to refine theoretical models.
- **Duffing oscillator** analysis shows how nonlinear systems transition from periodic motion to chaos.
